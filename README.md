# Ledger

A private, offline-first personal finance dashboard: budgeting, investments,
planning and compensation. Everything is stored in your own browser. There is
no backend, no account, and no telemetry. Optional Google Drive sync moves a
snapshot between your own devices using your own OAuth client, with the
narrow `drive.file` scope.

## Running it

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The app is served under the `/ledger/` base path with hash routing, so the dev
URL is http://localhost:5173/ledger/#/budget.

## Verifying it

```bash
npm run verify
```

That runs, in order: eslint, the unit suite (vitest), a production build, and
three guard scripts, then the end-to-end suite (Playwright, five viewport
projects). CI runs exactly this on every push and pull request. All of it must
be green before a change lands.

Individual pieces:

| Command | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | eslint over the whole repo |
| `npm test` | unit and component tests, watch mode |
| `npm test -- --run` | unit and component tests, once |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -b` then a production vite build |
| `npm run check:bundle` | no chunk over budget, entry graph within budget |
| `npm run check:eager` | recharts stays out of the eager entry graph |
| `npm run check:type-scale` | no raw `text-[10px]` / `text-[11px]` |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright, five viewport projects |

## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/utils/finance` | Pure financial maths: tax, amortization, forecasting, Monte Carlo. No React. |
| `src/utils/budget` | Pure budget maths: periods, splits, recurrence, dedupe, category stats. |
| `src/utils/investments` | Pure portfolio maths: valuation, allocation, realized gains, the wheel. |
| `src/store` | zustand stores, all persisted to localStorage. `storageKeys.ts` is the registry. |
| `src/services/marketData` | Quote, historical and FX fetching, with caching and in-flight dedup. |
| `src/components` | Presentation, grouped by feature area. |
| `src/pages` | One per route. |
| `e2e` | Playwright guards, including per-theme accessibility. |
| `scripts` | The three bespoke build guards. |
| `docs/superpowers/plans` | Implementation plans, one per project. |

The maths layer is pure and fully unit-tested; components read through it and
never re-derive a number themselves.

## Data and storage

Every persisted store is registered in `src/store/storageKeys.ts`. Adding a
store there is all it takes for it to be included in backups and Drive
snapshots. **Never change a value in that registry**: it is the on-disk
contract with existing installs.

`src/utils/backup.ts` builds and restores the backup envelope. Snapshots carry
the writing app's version, and a pull only prunes stores the writing build
actually knew about, so syncing from a device on an older release cannot
destroy data that release predates.

## Themes

Six themes, defined as CSS custom properties in `src/index.css` under
`[data-theme='...']`. Adding a seventh means touching every block in that file
plus `useThemeStore.ts` (`AppTheme`, `THEME_CYCLE`, `LIGHT_THEMES`,
`THEME_BACKGROUNDS`), `themeSwatches.ts`, and the per-theme e2e guards.
