      // scripts/check-eager-graph.mjs, which fails the build if that is ever
      // undone), and the Dashboard/Planner widgets that do use recharts are
      // React.lazy-loaded. Naming those chunks with a `charts-` prefix used
      // to rely on manual `codeSplitting.groups` entries for `charts` and
      // `charts-vendor`, but that API force-links every declared group's
      // chunk into the entry for this rolldown version regardless of true
      // reachability, which defeated the whole point once the entry no
      // longer actually needed recharts. The `charts-` naming is done in
      // output.chunkFileNames below instead, which only affects the
      // filename, not what gets linked into the entry. The chart chunk is
      // now genuinely deferred, but it is still kept in the PWA precache
      // deliberately: e2e/offline.spec.ts guards against a blank page when
      // offline before the runtime cache has filled in, and re-excluding
      // the chart chunk from precache to chase the "on demand" ideal would
      // need a new e2e case proving no such regression, which was not
