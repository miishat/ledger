# Phase 06: Total Compensation Calculator Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Break down and visualize total employment compensation.
**Verified:** 2026-06-19T19:30:00Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** Yes — after gap closure (06-04 closed UAT Test 3)

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Total comp breaks down into Base, Bonus, ESPP, RRSP, RSU and is visualized (donut + monthly view) — COMP-01 | ✓ VERIFIED | `useCompensationStore.ts` exports `calcAnnualBaseSalary/Bonus/ESPP/RRSP/RSU` + `calcTotalComp`; `CompHeroWidget.tsx` renders PieChart with all 5 component values (lines 74-78, 174-198); page wired via `App.tsx:10/35`, `Compensation.tsx:34` |
| 2 | Customizable equity/RSU vesting tracker with timeline — COMP-02 | ✓ VERIFIED | `EquityVestingWidget.tsx` uses ComposedChart + Bar + Line + ReferenceLine fed by `generateVestEvents` (lines 5,97,135,163,173); rendered in `Compensation.tsx:92` |
| 3 | Time-based modes (Current Year vs Next 1 Year) filter RSU vestings — COMP-03 | ✓ VERIFIED | `TimeMode` type + `timeMode` state + `setTimeMode` in store; `calcAnnualRSU` filters vest events by calendar window (store lines 125-147); toggle in `CompHeroWidget.tsx:139-148` ("Current Year"/"Next 1 Year") |
| 4 | User can enter one or more RSU/equity grants for the compare offer (name, shares, grant price, start date, vesting schedule) | ✓ VERIFIED | `CompareView.tsx` draft state lines 31-38, inline form lines 164-214 (grant name, shares, price, start date, vesting preset select, frequency, custom months); `addCompareRsuGrant` builds VestingSchedule lines 40-61 |
| 5 | User can add and remove RSU grants in the compare form before calculating | ⚠️ See human verification | `addCompareRsuGrant` (line 40) + `removeCompareRsuGrant` (line 63) + Add Grant button (line 218) + removable list (lines 224-239) all present and wired; live add/remove render is a UI interaction not exercised by an automated test |
| 6 | After calculating, the RSU (Annual) compare row shows a non-$0 value when grants were entered | ✓ VERIFIED | Runtime check of real `calcAnnualRSU` returned **37500** for an in-window 1000-share grant and **0** for empty grants; `handleCalculate` passes `rsuGrants: compareRsuGrants` (line 82); cell reads `calcAnnualRSU(comparePackage, timeMode)` (line 317) |
| 7 | RSU (Annual) delta reflects the real primary-vs-compare difference (not always $0 on the compare side) | ✓ VERIFIED | Delta computed as `calcAnnualRSU(comparePackage) - calcAnnualRSU(primaryPackage)` (lines 319-320); compare side now fed real grants; non-zero/zero asymmetry confirmed by runtime check |

**Score:** 7/7 truths verified (1 also routed to human verification for the UI add/remove interaction)

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/store/useCompensationStore.ts` | Store + calc functions + timeMode filtering | ✓ VERIFIED | All exports present; `calcAnnualRSU` filters by timeMode; persist key `ledger-compensation` |
| `src/components/compensation/CompHeroWidget.tsx` | Donut + monthly + timeMode toggle | ✓ VERIFIED | PieChart 5 slices, monthly view, Current/Next-1-Year toggle |
| `src/components/compensation/EquityVestingWidget.tsx` | Vesting timeline (Bar + Line + cliff) | ✓ VERIFIED | ComposedChart with ReferenceLine cliff marker |
| `src/components/compensation/CompensationModal.tsx` | Multi-section primary input | ✓ VERIFIED | Imported/rendered in `Compensation.tsx:108` |
| `src/components/compensation/CompareView.tsx` | Compare form + RSU sub-form + delta table | ✓ VERIFIED | RSU sub-form added (06-04); `rsuGrants: compareRsuGrants` wired |
| `src/pages/Compensation.tsx` | Page assembling all widgets | ✓ VERIFIED | Imports + renders all four components |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CompareView.tsx | useCompensationStore.ts | `rsuGrants: compareRsuGrants` into setComparePackage | ✓ WIRED | Line 82; hardcoded `rsuGrants: []` confirmed ABSENT |
| CompareView.tsx | useCompensationStore.ts | `calcAnnualRSU(comparePackage, timeMode)` consumes grants | ✓ WIRED | Line 317 (cell) + 319-320 (delta) |
| Compensation.tsx | CompareView/EquityVestingWidget/CompHeroWidget | imports + render | ✓ WIRED | Lines 2-5, 34, 92, 104, 108 |
| App.tsx | pages/Compensation | route `/compensation` | ✓ WIRED | Import line 10, route line 35; no placeholder div |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CompareView RSU cell | `comparePackage.rsuGrants` | local `compareRsuGrants` state → `setComparePackage` → `calcAnnualRSU` | Yes (37500 for in-window grant; 0 only when empty) | ✓ FLOWING |
| CompHeroWidget donut | `primaryPackage` calc values | Zustand store (persisted) | Yes | ✓ FLOWING |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run build` (tsc -b && vite build) | `npm run build` | exit 0, clean | ✓ PASS |
| Vitest suite | `npx vitest run` | 3 files, 4 tests passed | ✓ PASS |
| `calcAnnualRSU` non-zero for in-window grant | `npx tsx` against real source | 37500 (grant), 0 (empty) | ✓ PASS |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| COMP-01 | 06-01 | Base salary, cash bonuses, employer benefits breakdown | ✓ SATISFIED | Store calc fns + CompHeroWidget donut |
| COMP-02 | 06-02, 06-04 | Customizable equity tracker for RSU/Options vesting schedules | ✓ SATISFIED | EquityVestingWidget + CompareView RSU sub-form |
| COMP-03 | 06-03 | Time-based modes (Current vs Next 1 Year) filtering RSU vestings | ✓ SATISFIED | TimeMode filtering in calcAnnualRSU + toggle |

No orphaned requirements: REQUIREMENTS.md maps exactly COMP-01/02/03 to this module, and all three appear in plan frontmatter.

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. All six phase source files scanned clean for TBD/FIXME/XXX/HACK/PLACEHOLDER and stub patterns. The previously hardcoded `rsuGrants: []` is confirmed removed.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Compare-offer RSU add/remove and rendered delta (closes UAT Test 3)

**Test:** On `/compensation`, enter a primary package (base salary + RSU grant), click "Compare Another Offer", add one or more RSU grants in the compare form (name, shares, price, start date, vesting preset), remove one, then click "Calculate Comparison".
**Expected:** The compare grant list updates live on add/remove; after Calculate, the "RSU (Annual)" compare-offer cell shows a non-$0 value and the delta badge shows a real +/- difference (not "Equivalent"/$0).
**Why human:** The add/remove and rendered RSU cell are React UI interactions. The underlying `calcAnnualRSU` is behaviorally proven (37500 with grant, 0 without), but the click-through render and the in-window timeMode caveat (a today-dated 4yr/1yr-cliff grant's first vest lands next calendar year and is filtered out under the default 'current-year' mode, which could surprise a tester) can only be confirmed in the running app.

### Gaps Summary

No blocking gaps. The 06-04 gap-closure fully addresses UAT Test 3: the compare form now has a complete RSU/equity sub-form (name, shares, grant price, start date, vesting preset, frequency, custom months), working add/remove handlers, and the collected grants flow into `setComparePackage` via `rsuGrants: compareRsuGrants` (the old hardcoded `rsuGrants: []` is gone). The RSU (Annual) compare cell and delta consume `calcAnnualRSU(comparePackage, timeMode)`, which a runtime check proves returns real non-zero values (37500) when grants are present and 0 when empty. Build and tests pass clean. All three requirements (COMP-01/02/03) are satisfied in code. One item is routed to human verification — the live UI add/remove interaction and rendered compare delta — because it is a browser interaction not covered by an automated test, with a noted timeMode in-window caveat for the tester.
