# Financial Dashboard Web App

## What This Is

A highly scalable, cross-platform financial dashboard web app (PWA) that gives users deep, actionable insights into their financial health across net worth, budgeting, investments, future projections, and total compensation. It features a strict modular architecture with a high-density Bento Grid layout and an unapologetically premium dual-theme system (Tactical Monospace and Geometric Abstraction). Shipped as v1.0 MVP — local-first, manual-entry, no backend.

## Core Value

A striking, uncompromising user experience that makes managing personal wealth feel like operating a premium engineering command center.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Shipped and confirmed valuable. -->

- ✓ Global Navigation for module switching and theme toggling — v1.0
- ✓ Dual-theme system (Tactical Monospace vs. Geometric Abstraction) via Tailwind CSS — v1.0
- ✓ High-density Bento Grid layout with strictly self-contained component wrappers — v1.0
- ✓ Master Dashboard (Net Worth) view — v1.0
- ✓ Budgeting Module for cash flow, income, and categorized expenses — v1.0
- ✓ "Investment Plan vs. Actual" Tracker (Recharts) — v1.0
- ✓ Future Projections visualization tool (compounding/savings) — v1.0
- ✓ Total Compensation Calculator (base, bonus, RSU/Options vesting, time-based modes) — v1.0

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these — next milestone. -->

(None yet — define with `/gsd-new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- [Live Bank Sync (e.g., Plaid)] — Deferred beyond v1 to focus on local-first PWA and core layout foundations.
- [Complex Backend Database] — Vite SPA + LocalStorage chosen for a fast, client-side PWA architecture.
- [User authentication & cloud sync] — Deferred to v2; local-first remains the v1 priority.

## Context

- **Shipped:** v1.0 MVP on 2026-06-19 — 6 phases, 11 plans, ~3,700 LOC TypeScript/React across 3 days.
- **Tech stack (as built):** React + Vite SPA, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Zustand (with persist middleware), React Router, Recharts, vite-plugin-pwa. Deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.
- The app acts as a PWA with local-first persistence (LocalStorage / Zustand persist).
- UI aesthetic is paramount: strictly no generic Bootstrap-style templates. The design language impresses power users with high-contrast, strictly structured aesthetics.
- Architecture relies on a component-based model where widget cards accept only children, decoupling layout from widget logic entirely.
- **Known state:** Investments and Projections pages carry "coming soon" notices for future enhancements; all core widgets are functional and verified.

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: React (Vite SPA), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion — Ensures rapid client-side performance, fluid animations, and easy theme switching.
- **State Management**: Zustand or React Context — For managing global financial data locally.
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts — Selected over Chart.js because SVG-based rendering natively supports Tailwind CSS variables for seamless real-time theme swapping.
- **Design Layout**: High-density Bento Grid — Row-based equal-sized cards are forbidden to avoid the "generic template" look.

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Vite + LocalStorage | Prioritize local-first, blazing-fast PWA performance over immediate server/database complexity. | ✓ Good — shipped v1.0, no backend needed for MVP |
| Manual Data Entry | Focus on building core UI/UX features and charting logic before tackling 3rd-party financial APIs like Plaid. | ✓ Good — kept v1.0 scope tight |
| Recharts for Charts | SVG-based charts support CSS variables natively, enabling instant, redraw-free theme transitions between Dark/Light modes. | ✓ Good — used across Investment, Projection, Equity widgets |
| Bento Grid Component Architecture | Cards act only as layout wrappers taking `children`, enabling easy drag-and-drop or 1-line swaps in the layout map. | ✓ Good — clean widget composition throughout |
| Zustand persist middleware | Persist financial state across sessions without a backend. | ✓ Good — local-first state for all modules (v1.0) |
| GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages | Ship the PWA with zero-infra static hosting. | ✓ Good — deploy pipeline live (v1.0) |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
